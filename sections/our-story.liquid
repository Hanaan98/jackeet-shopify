          <div class="story-year">SINCE 1987</div>
          <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
          <p>JACKEETA was born from a simple belief: that exceptional clothing should be both timeless and accessible. Founded in 1987, our journey began with a single workshop and a commitment to craftsmanship that would define decades to come.</p>
          <p>What started as a small atelier has grown into a respected name in premium fashion, but our core values remain unchanged – quality, integrity, and an unwavering dedication to the art of garment making.</p>

          <p>Our approach combines traditional tailoring techniques with contemporary design sensibilities. We don't chase fleeting trends; instead, we focus on perfecting the fundamentals: impeccable fit, superior materials, and meticulous attention to detail.</p>
